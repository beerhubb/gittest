### Introducing the PITCHME.md Convention

#### The README.md Convention

If you have ever worked with Git - on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket - you are
probably already familiar with this convention. It automatically turns any
README.md file found within a Git repository into nicely rendered documentation.
This convention gives developers a simple and convenient way to document any
project.

#### The PITCHME.md Convention

GitPitch introduces a brand new convention for all Git users, the PITCHME.md
convention. This convention automatically turns any PITCHME.md file found
within a Git repository into a modern slideshow presentation on
[gitpitch.com](https://gitpitch.com). This convention gives developers a simple
and convenient way to promote, pitch or present absolutely anything. Using the
tools we already know and love - Markdown and Git.

### The GitPitch Backstory

GitPitch began as a personal project back in 2016. The early versions of the
service were maintained as an open source project in this repository. I now
work on this project full-time and develop a wide range of
[free, subscriber, and enterprise](https://gitpitch.com/pricing) slide deck
solutions. You can still fork, clone, or modify the original source and open
new issues and feature requests on this repo. For project news and updates,
follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitpitch).

If you like this project please show your support with a
[GitHub Star](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/stargazers). Your support is
much appreciated. Cheers, David :heart:.
